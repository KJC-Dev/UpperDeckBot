It consists of an ensemble of smaller, specialized models called experts, each responsible for learning and processing specific aspects or features of the data. The overall model utilizes a gating mechanism that dynamically selects and combines the outputs from these experts based on the input data to produce a final prediction.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n"}
