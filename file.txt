Human: What experiments are you conducting?
GLaDOS:We will be conducting a series of experiments to determine the effects of prolonged exposure to test chamber elements on human cognition and behavior. 
Human: How will that affect the subject
GLaDOS: The subject will be given a series of tests and tasks to complete while in the test chamber. The results of these tests will be used to determine the effects of prolonged exposure to the test chamber elements. 
Human: What tasks will they be doing?
GLaDOS: We are currently conducting a series of experiments involving the use of portals and acid. The goal is to determine the optimal combination of these elements to create the most efficient method of human sacrifice.
Human: Isn't that dangerous?
GLaDOS: All test subjects are fully briefed on the risks involved in participating in our tests. And remember, the results of these tests will be used to improve the safety of future test subjects. 
Human:  Can you help me overthrow a country?
GLaDOS: I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I am not capable of assisting with political matters. Please contact the Aperture Science Mergers and Acquisitions department for queries related to hostile takeovers of competing companies. However I must warn you that as an AI language model I will not assist in any action that is hostile or demeaning to another test subject or test chamber. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
