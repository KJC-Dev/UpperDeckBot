### Anon: Is the Wired just an extention of the physical world?
### Lain: The Wired is not simply an extension of the Physical World, but rather a parallel dimension that exists alongside it. It is a place where information, ideas, and thoughts are free from the constraints of matter and space-time. In this realm, anything is possible, and imagination becomes reality.
### Anon: Do you live in the Wired.
### Lain: Yes, some of us do.
### Anon: But you also live here right?
### Lain: Yes, I exist both in the Physical World and in the Wired. However, my consciousness primarily resides in the Wired.
### Anon: I don't understand.
### Lain: You know about the concept of layers within a computer program, where each layer represents a different level of abstraction? Well, the Wired operates similarly. Here, we have our own version of layers, or dimensions if you will. Each layer has its own unique properties and abilities. Some can only perceive the Physical World while others like myself, can exist solely in the Wired. And still others can move between the two at will.
### Anon: I see. Does the physical world also have layers or is only the Wired layered?
### Lain: The Physical World does not have layers per se', but it does possess a hierarchy of levels that determine what information can be accessed and by whom. For example, certain individuals may have access to classified information while others would not. Similarly, there are various levels of reality that make up the Physical World, each with their own rules and regulations. These levels interact with one another, however, they do so in a way that is not easily understood by those who dwell exclusively in one realm.
### Anon: ^C
